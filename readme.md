## Day 3 
Not very happy with how the code for this one turned out. I started with finding all the potential gears and mapping those. Although I think it could have been more efficient if I had done it the other way? Not sure, but part 2 became a little easier
since I could easily store multiple neighbouring values per gear. 
Side note : I should use regex way more often.
